                        every dark shade cast by our fights, i see,  
a part of you slipping further from me,
in my heart, your light still glows
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        iâ€™ve hurt you, i know, with careless ways,  
left you in anger that lingers for days.  
but my promise to you will always remain:  
to rebuild everything, to heal the pain. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        youâ€™re the reason my heart feels whole and complete,  
even when silence and distance compete.  
in loving you, iâ€™ve always been found,  
through every struggle, my love finds you in every crowd. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        so here i am, with my heart in my hand offering to you
hoping to meet with the hopes,
with every mistake, i seek to renew,
together, always, foreverâ€”i choose you.

                    <p>about the time earlier i mentioned something that made you uncomfortable. i want to tell you that i understand how it came across, and i am greatly sorry for making you feel uneasy.</p>

<p>it was never my intention to hurt you and cause discomfort. i realize how thoughtless it was to bring it up in the way i did, especially without considering how you might feel about it. i should have been more sensitive and mindful. that moment has been weighing on my mind because the last thing i want is for you to feel anything but safe and respected.</p>

<p>mahal, i value your comfort and boundaries so much. iâ€™ve been trying to understand how my words or actions might have come across and how they may have made you feel. i realize that what i said wasnâ€™t right, and i take full responsibility for it. i know an apology alone isnâ€™t enoughâ€”i need to show you, through my actions, that i respect you and will be more thoughtful next time.</p>

<p>your feelings, your trust, and your happiness are things i hold really important. it breaks my heart to think that i made you feel otherwise. i want to reassure you that i take your feelings seriously, and i will always strive to be a better partner for you.</p>

<p>youâ€™ve always been so patient with me gaa:(( i promise to be more careful with my words, to think before i speak, and to ensure that i am always considerate of your feelings. gaa, i donâ€™t want to be a source of discomfort for you; i want to be someone who uplifts you and makes you feel safe and loved. i am hoping you can forgive me for that carelessness.</p>

<p>i loooveeeyoouuu sooo muuch mahal</p>

<p>langga,</p>

<p>iâ€™ve thought long and hard about the words you shared with me. every time we argue and the issue isnâ€™t resolved quickly, it eats away at you, leaving you drained and distant. i can feel the weight of that distance, and it hurts me much. i know itâ€™s not easy for you to deal with these feelings, and iâ€™m deeply sorry that iâ€™ve been a cause of your pain.</p>

<p>youâ€™ve been honest with me, even when itâ€™s hard to say those things. and while your words cut deep, theyâ€™re also a reminder of how much iâ€™ve failed to be the partner you deserve. itâ€™s not easy for me to hear that you feel like youâ€™re missing the freedom of being single, or that our arguments make you lose your energy and joy. but iâ€™m grateful that youâ€™ve shared this with me, because it gives me the chance to understand your pain and do better.</p>

<p>gaa, you are my everything. i know iâ€™ve fallen short in showing that to you, especially during times when you needed me most. iâ€™ve let my pride and impatience get in the way of fixing things quickly, and iâ€™ve allowed the space between us to grow when i shouldâ€™ve been closing it. for all of that, i am so sorry.</p>

<p>your feelings are so valid, and i want you to know that i hear you. i see the toll it takes on you when we fight and how it makes you feel distant from us. i hate that iâ€™ve made you feel like this. i hate that iâ€™ve been the reason youâ€™ve questioned your happiness with me.</p>

<p>but gaa, i'm not willing to be like this. you mean so much to me. you are the person i choose every single day, and i want to keep choosing you for the rest of my life. i want to regain your trust, your joy with me. i want us to heal from the wounds i've caused and find our way back.</p>

<p>i know that words alone wonâ€™t fix things. i can write hundreds to thousands worded letters, but they wonâ€™t mean a thing if my actions donâ€™t reflect them. here's my promise to you: i will do better. i will listen more. i will work on my patience and be more understanding. i will take the time to address the issues we face instead na hayaan lumala.</p>

<p>i donâ€™t want you to feel like you have to carry the weight of our relationship alone. i want to be your partner in every sense of the wordâ€”to share your burdens, to lift you up, and to be the person who makes you feel safe and loved. i want you to see that iâ€™m here for you, through every high and every low.</p>

<p>beebii, you're the one i think about when i wake up and the one i dream about when i'm sleeping. i know that rebuilding trust and closeness will take time, but iâ€™m willing to do whatever it takes. i want to be the person who makes you feel excited about being in a relationship, not someone who drains your energy.</p>

<p>youâ€™ve told me how our arguments affect you, how they linger and make you feel turned off and distant. i hear that, and i take it seriously. i donâ€™t want you to feel like that anymore. i want to work on myself so that i can be the partner you deserveâ€”the partner who brings you peace instead of stress, who lifts you up instead of weighing you down.</p>

<p>youâ€™ve been so patient with me mahal, and i donâ€™t take that for granted. i know iâ€™ve always pushed your limits, and i know iâ€™ve hurt you much. but i also know that our love is worth fighting for. i believe in us, even in the times when it feels like weâ€™re struggling. and i will keep believing in us, no matter what.</p>

<p>thank you for being honest with me, even when itâ€™s hard. thank you for giving me the chance to make things right. thank you for being the great person. iâ€™m so grateful that youâ€™re mine.</p>

<p>i want you to know that i see your worth so much langga. i see how amazing person you are, and i feel so lucky to be loved by you. i donâ€™t take that lightly. i want to be someone who makes you feel cherished and valued every single day.</p>

<p>bikoo, i loovvve youuu soo so much. i love you more, i love you most. and iâ€™m willing to put in the effort to show you that, not just in letters, but in the way i treat you, in the way i listen to you, and in the way i support you. you always have the biggest part of my heart, my everything.</p>

<p>love, <br> janny</p>
